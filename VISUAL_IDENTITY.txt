GENOPROTEOMICS VISUAL IDENTITY CONCEPT
======================================

LOGO CONCEPT
------------
A minimal, abstract mark that visually bridges the genome-to-proteome concept.

Primary concept: An intertwined double helix (DNA) that transitions or morphs 
into a folded protein structure (alpha helix or abstract 3D fold). The left 
side of the mark shows the characteristic ladder/twist of DNA, which 
seamlessly flows into a more complex, folded shape on the right—symbolizing 
the transformation from genetic code to functional protein.

Alternative concept: A stylized "G" letterform where the crossbar is formed 
by a small folded protein motif, and the curve incorporates a subtle double 
helix pattern. This would work well as a favicon and social media avatar.

Visual qualities to emphasize:
- Clean, geometric lines (not overly organic or "biotech-slick")
- Single continuous stroke if possible (representing the flow from gene to protein)
- Works at small sizes (favicon, mobile)
- Recognizable in single color

Avoid:
- Literal DNA double helix clichés
- Overly complex protein ribbon diagrams
- Generic "sciencey" swooshes or gradients


COLOR PALETTE
-------------
Primary:    #0D7377  (Deep Teal)
            A rich teal that evokes both structural biology visualization 
            software and the scientific rigor of the field. Confident and 
            distinctive without being flashy.

Secondary:  #1A2A2A  (Near Black)
            For body text and strong contrasts. Softer than pure black, 
            easier on the eyes for long-form reading.

Accent:     #14A3A8  (Light Teal)
            For hover states, highlights, and secondary emphasis. Provides 
            energy and interactivity cues.

Background: #FAFBFC  (Off-White)
            A very subtle cool gray that's gentler than pure white and 
            creates a calm, focused reading environment.


TYPOGRAPHY
----------
Headings:   Source Serif 4 (or similar transitional serif)
            - Conveys scholarly authority and timelessness
            - The slight warmth of a serif balances the technical content
            - Use semibold (600) weight for hierarchy

Body:       Source Sans 3 (or similar humanist sans-serif)
            - Clean and highly legible for scientific text
            - Professional without being cold
            - Use regular (400) for body, medium (500) for emphasis

Code/Data:  JetBrains Mono or Fira Code (monospace)
            - For code snippets, pipeline names, or data annotations
            - Ligatures optional depending on context

Type scale should emphasize generous line spacing (1.6–1.8 for body text) 
to improve readability of dense scientific content.


OVERALL AESTHETIC
-----------------
Calm, quantitative, modern computational biology.

The design should feel like a well-organized research notebook or a 
high-quality scientific review journal—trustworthy, precise, and 
approachable. It should communicate intellectual seriousness without 
intimidation, and technical depth without clutter.

Think: the clarity of a Nature Methods figure, the restraint of a 
well-designed preprint, the accessibility of a good textbook. 
Not a biotech startup landing page. Not a pharma corporate site. 
Not a flashy conference poster.

The visual language should support long-form reading and complex 
information hierarchies. Whitespace is a feature, not empty space 
to fill. Every visual element should serve comprehension.
